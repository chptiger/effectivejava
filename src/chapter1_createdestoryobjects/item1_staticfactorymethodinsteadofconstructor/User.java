	/**
	 * createWithDefaultCountry is a static factory method
	 * 
	 * Advantages of static factory methods: 
	 * 	1. unlike constructors, they have names. --> easy to understand.
	 * 	2. unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked. --> fly-weight pattern
	 * 	3. unlike constructors, they can return an object of any sub-type of their return type.  -> return subType
	 * 		e.x. Collections 
	 *  4. the class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
	 *  5. the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.
