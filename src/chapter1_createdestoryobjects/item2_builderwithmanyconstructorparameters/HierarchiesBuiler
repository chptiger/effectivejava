I do not understand hierarchies Builer pattern.

Note that Pizza.Builder is a generic type with a recursive type parameter (Item 30). 
This, along with the abstract self method, allows method chaining to work properly in subclasses, without the need for casts. 
This workaround for the fact that Java lacks a self type is known as the simulated self-type idiom.
